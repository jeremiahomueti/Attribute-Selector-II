}

So any section, where the class is "post"...

section[class="post"]
{
    width: 300px;
    color: yellow;
}

It'll be much better to just do this:


.post{
    width: 300px;
    color: yellow;
}

...but it's good to know you can do the above in line 22.

a[href*="google"]

the latter is not for hrefs only. We can do it in such a way 
that any input that contains the first initial 'P' or 'J'
